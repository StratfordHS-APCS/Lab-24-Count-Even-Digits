# Lab 24 - Count Even Digits

## Lab Goal
You will be writing a recursive method that will count the number of even digits in an integer.

## Instructions
 * Complete the `countEvens` method to **recursively** count the number of even digits in an integer.
 * You'll want to use `%` and `/` to separate one digit at a time from the integer.
 * Complete the main method to ask the user for an integer and then output how many even digits there are.

### Testing

To run the automated tests select the 'Shell' tab and enter the command `mvn test` to run the tests.
